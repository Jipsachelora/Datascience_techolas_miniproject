# Datascience_miniproject_techolas_ML-Model-Flask-Deployment

Dataset :intend to collect experimental data of nanomaterial to analyse the properties and to develop a predicitve model bto predict important properties such as logp, zetapotential and cellular upatke. so that it may result into a new nanomaterial design with better properties.

Project Structure:

miniproject_2_techolas.py - This contains code fot our Machine Learning model to predict .
app.py - This contains Flask APIs that receives nanomaterial details through GUI or API calls, computes the precited value based on our model and returns it.
template- HTML template to allow user to enter details and displays the prediction.
